python_rest_api_client
======================

A sample Python client for communicating with the UltraDNS REST API

Dependencies
============

This sample code depends on the requests library, which can be found at: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/

The library will automatically be installed by pip.

Installation
============

Use pip to install from the git repository.

```bash
$ cd python_rest_api_client
$ pip install .
```

Functionality
=============

The sample code does not attempt to implement a client for all available UltraDNS REST API functionality.  It provides access to basic functionality.  Adding additional functionality should be relatively straightforward, and any contributions from the UltraDNS community would be greatly appreciated.  See sample.py for an example of how to use this library in your own code.

Questions
=========

Please contact UltraDNS support if you have any questions or encounter any issues with this code.
